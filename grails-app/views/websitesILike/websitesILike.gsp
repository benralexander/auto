    <div class="container linkContainerHolder">


        <g:linkDesc buttonName="D3" linkUrl="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki">
            Mike Bostock is amazing, and D3  is far and away my favorite graphics package.  Follow this link and look through some of his graphics examples if you haven't already.
        </g:linkDesc>

        <g:linkDesc buttonName="D. Berry" linkUrl="http://www.molecularmovies.com/movies/viewanimatorstudio/Drew%20Berry/">
            A collection of some of the molecular biology animations that have been created by Drew Berry.  I find his work really amazing, and after I view it
            I feel as if I can grasp some of the intricacies of biological processes in a deeper way.
        </g:linkDesc>

        <g:linkDesc buttonName="Genomes" linkUrl="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">
            Everyone should know that the human genome
            is an open resource (<a class="standardLinks" href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/14-1361.Opinion.12-15-2014.1.PDF">Myriad</a> be damned), and that anyone can
            look through the sequence of bases that make up our DNA and draw their own conclusions. I provide a link to the venerable old UCSC Genome Browser.
        </g:linkDesc>

        <g:linkDesc buttonName="Exome proj" linkUrl="http://exac.broadinstitute.org/">
            The website describing Daniel MacArthur's Exome Aggregation project.  Examine the data here or else
            download everything  and process it yourself.
        </g:linkDesc>

        <g:linkDesc buttonName="Tumor portal" linkUrl="http://www.tumorportal.org/">
            What is the relationship between particular genes and cancer lines? Investigate further at the tumor portal.
        </g:linkDesc>

        <g:linkDesc buttonName="DN!" linkUrl="http://www.democracynow.org/">
            Amy Goodman is definitely a hero of mine, and Democracy Now! is my first choice for broadcast news.
        </g:linkDesc>

        <g:linkDesc buttonName="BKA" linkUrl="http://www.brucekalexander.com/index.php">
            My dad's website-- other family members to follow (likely excepting my daughter, who is utterly appalled at the very notion of linking
            her web presence to mine).
        </g:linkDesc>

        <g:linkDesc buttonName="EdX" linkUrl="https://www.edx.org/">
            I love the idea of free education for the masses  from many of the best universities in the world.  I've taken more than a few of these classes myself and learned a huge amount.
            (I only audit the courses  usually, but it seems like a great way to get free access to awesome lectures, and who can complain about that?)
        </g:linkDesc>

        <g:linkDesc buttonName="Lynda" linkUrl="http://www.lynda.com/">
            This is a commercial site and I'm not endorsing them in any way. I am a member, however, and for the money I have to say that I've learned quite a bit.
        </g:linkDesc>

        <g:linkDesc buttonName="ngram" linkUrl="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=&case_insensitive=on&year_start=1600&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=">
            Answers this question: how commonly are particular words/phrases encountered in published works over the last few hundred years? What a fascinating tool.
        </g:linkDesc>

        <g:linkDesc buttonName="revolution" linkUrl="http://globalrevolution.tv/">
            Global revolution.tv.  The resulting website  seems a bit scattershot, but I like the idea.
        </g:linkDesc>

        <g:linkDesc buttonName="cyriak" linkUrl="http://cyriak.co.uk/blog/">
            Totally, unreservedly bizarre. I like it, though I'm sure his stuff is not for everyone.
        </g:linkDesc>
